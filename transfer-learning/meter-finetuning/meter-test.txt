and chiefly i remember	iambic.tri
being honour bred, with one	iambic.tri
and they will differ-- if they do--	iambic.tetra
as two in whom they were proved mistaken,	iambic.tetra
as the deathbed whereon it must expire,	iambic.penta
from any brazen throat,	iambic.tri
as in a ruin we it call	iambic.tetra
i reade it in thy lookes, thy languisht grace,	iambic.penta
that mountain as his garden mould high rais'd	iambic.penta
not so, when swift camilla scours the plain,	iambic.penta
my very life again though cold in death;	iambic.penta
in the howling storm	chol.iamb
but doth suffer a sea change	iambic.tetra
but our old subtle foe so tempteth me	iambic.penta
for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night	iambic.penta
where springs not fail,	iambic.di
and wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil	iambic.penta
one foot went through. the view was all in lines	iambic.penta
the sedge has withered from the lake,	iambic.tetra
she seemed a thing that could not feel	iambic.tetra
i am his highness' dog at kew;	iambic.tetra
ancestral voices prophesying war!	iambic.penta
the speculating rooks at their nests cawed	iambic.penta
true ease in writing comes from art, not chance,	iambic.penta
and is always as nobly requited;	chol.iamb
he clasps the crag with crooked hands;	iambic.tetra
sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom,	iambic.penta
and learn me how to lose a winning match,	iambic.penta
flies o'er th'unbending corn, and skims along the main.	alexandr.iambic.hexa
which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,	iambic.penta
and he will make the face of heaven so fine	iambic.penta
i see a lily on thy brow,	iambic.tetra
twas brillig,  and the slithy toves	iambic.tetra
and then again, i have been told	iambic.tetra
is it no verse, except enchanted groves	iambic.penta
do they above love to be lov'd, and yet	iambic.penta
shrouds thee wheresoe'er thou shinest.	troch.tetra
tread softly because you tread on my dreams.	iambic.tetra
so love's inflamèd shaft or brand	iambic.tetra
part steals, lets part abide;	other
and a few lilies blow.	iambic.tri
look on my works, ye mighty, and despair!	iambic.penta
with danish barrows; and a hazel wood,	iambic.penta
christmas eve, and twelve of the clock	iambic.tetra
heard in dead night along that table-shore,	iambic.penta
then a mile of warm sea-scented beach;	iambic.tetra
when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st:	iambic.penta
fall, winter, fall; for he,	iambic.tri
and look upon myself, and curse my fate,	iambic.penta
amid whose swift half-intermitted burst	iambic.penta
has found out thy bed	chol.iamb
and i took all the blame out of all sense and reason,	alexandr.iambic.hexa
or free his feet, that in the myre sticke fast?	iambic.penta
flies o'er th' unbending corn,and skims along the main.	alexandr.iambic.hexa
and as in uffish thought he stood,	iambic.tetra
within the sonnet's scanty plot of ground;	iambic.penta
a savage place! as holy and enchanted	iambic.penta
in motion of no less celerity	iambic.penta
lovers can see to do their amorous rites	iambic.penta
its jewel of music is carven of all or of aught--	chol.iamb
huge sponges of millennial growth and height;	iambic.penta
who was so foolish as to think what he thought.	iambic.penta
until the latter fire shall heat the deep;	iambic.penta
as long ago, my love, how long ago.	iambic.penta
then, then (methinks) how sweetly flows	iambic.tetra
nothing of him that doth fade,	iambic.tetra
why wilt not let him pass, that long hath stood	iambic.penta
is not short paine well borne, that brings long ease,	iambic.penta
it was a miracle of rare device,	iambic.penta
no drum nor trumpet peaceful sleeps should move,	iambic.penta
the cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces	iambic.penta
and i yn my bed agayne	iambic.tri
again it is due?	iambic.di
the sound must seem an echo to the sense.	iambic.penta
of snow upon the mountains and the moors--	iambic.penta
come to my arms, my beamish boy!	iambic.tetra
sit blithe and happy;  bees that soar for bloom,	iambic.penta
behold me, for i cannot sleep,	iambic.tetra
that i would not have that view	iambic.tri
our object and inglorious, yet the end	iambic.penta
and piled--and measured, four by four by eight.	iambic.penta
o round mine eyes your tresses shake!	iambic.tetra
or is it only the breeze, in its listlessness	chol.iamb
because the holy ghost over the bent	iambic.penta
by chance or nature's changing course untrimmed;	iambic.penta
and true plain hearts do in the faces rest;	iambic.penta
in these years! yet, i feel,	iambic.tri
to sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,	iambic.penta
small is the worth	iambic.di
that i might live and share	iambic.tri
until next may	iambic.di
that now she knows,	iambic.di
the everlasting universe of things	iambic.penta
and hermits are contented with their cells,	iambic.penta
press'd her cold finger closer to her lips.	iambic.penta
and say, would god it came to pass	iambic.tetra
such as a feeble brook will oft assume	iambic.penta
love so alike that none do slacken, none can die.	alexandr.iambic.hexa
o how that glittering taketh me!	iambic.tetra
times told lovelier, more dangerous, omy chevalier!	iambic.penta
when we have wandered all our ways	iambic.tetra
as after sunset fadeth in the west;	iambic.penta
carry him off the way i might have gone,	iambic.penta
how silently, and with how wanne a face,	iambic.penta
featured like him, like him with friends  possessed,	iambic.penta
where the traveller's journey is done;	chol.iamb
from death to life thou mightst him yet recover.	iambic.penta
and get knocked on the head for his labours,	chol.iamb
singing of mount abora.	iambic.tetra
may no lines pass, except they do their duty	iambic.penta
"that murmur, soon replies, ""god doth not need"	iambic.penta
and very few to love.	iambic.tri
stirred for a bird,-- the achieve of, the mastery of the thing!	iambic.penta
and though the last lights off the black west went	iambic.penta
but let all lovers, rich in triumph, come	iambic.penta
except love's fires the virtue have	iambic.tetra
and shuns to have her graces spied,	iambic.tetra
can it be you that i hear? let me view you, then,	chol.iamb
consuming the last clouds of cold mortality.	alexandr.iambic.hexa
except you enthrall me, never shall be free,	iambic.penta
and there i dreamed-- ah! woe betide!--	iambic.tetra
haply i think on thee--and then my state,	iambic.penta
crushed.  why do men then now not reck his rod?	iambic.penta
and it was older sure than this year's cutting,	iambic.penta
with throbbings of noontide.	iambic.tri
death's second self, that seals up all in rest.	iambic.penta
which from his darksome passage now appears,	iambic.penta
tread softly because you tread on my dreams.	iambic.tetra
ask for that lowest place, but thou hast died	iambic.penta
in truth the prison unto which we doom	iambic.penta

his overcoat for ever,	iambic.tri
and try if we cannot feel forsaken.	iambic.tetra
because of all things known	iambic.tri

child of light! thy limbs are burning	troch.tetra
confusion of the death-bed over, is it sent	alexandr.iambic.hexa
and innocence is closing up his eyes,	iambic.penta
thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies,	iambic.penta
ourselves, no prison is: and hence for me,	iambic.penta
and every fair from fair sometimes declines,	iambic.penta
ah sun-flower, weary of time,	chol.iamb
as the radiant lines of morning	troch.tetra
from sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;	iambic.penta
into its narrow shed.	iambic.tri
it was an abyssinian maid,	iambic.tetra
came whiffling through the tulgey wood.	iambic.tetra
where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;	iambic.penta
through wood and dale the sacred river ran,	iambic.penta
nor less, when spring had warmed the cultured vale,	iambic.penta
we pictured the meek mild creatures where	iambic.tetra
my very life again though cold in death;	iambic.penta
who travels by the wearie wandring way,	iambic.penta
the sighing sound, the lights around the shore.	iambic.penta
standing as when i drew near to the town	chol.iamb
generations have trod, have trod, have trod;	iambic.penta

droop herbs and flowers;	iambic.di

pause answer to pause, and again the same strain caught,	chol.iamb
the touch of earthly years.	iambic.tri

i would spread the cloths under your feet:	iambic.tetra

confusion of the death-bed over, is it sent	alexandr.iambic.hexa
whose sails were never to the tempest given;	iambic.penta
what the hammer? what the chain?	iambic.tetra
i look into my glass,	iambic.tri
pleased if some souls (for such there needs must be)	iambic.penta
though i am young, and cannot tell	iambic.tetra
when yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang	iambic.penta
hawk, heron, owl, and woodpecker.	iambic.tetra

with despair?	other

nay, ihave done,you get no more of me,	iambic.penta
shouldering the naked crag, oh, at that time	iambic.penta
"our childhood used to know,"""	iambic.tri
and from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,	iambic.penta
and not another like it could i see.	iambic.penta
i know the grass beyond the door,	iambic.tetra
i warm'd both hands before the fire of life;	iambic.penta
thy glory by thy side.	iambic.tri
but time to make me grieve,	iambic.tri
as sponges-- buckets-- do--	iambic.tri
suffer herself to be desired,	iambic.tetra

thro' the vest which seems to hide them;	troch.tetra
i look into my glass,	iambic.tri
whenas in silks my julia goes,	chol.iamb
how long ago i may not know:	iambic.tetra
for love, all love of other sights controls,	iambic.penta
as two in whom they were provedmistaken,	iambic.tetra
amid a place of stone,	iambic.tri
o how that glittering taketh me!	iambic.tetra

in the wild woods, amongthe mountains lone,	iambic.penta
then bloody swords and armor should not be;	iambic.penta

of beauty from the light retired;	iambic.tetra
he chortled in his joy.	iambic.tri
ease after warre, death after life does greatly please.	iambic.penta
that sunny dome! those caves of ice!	iambic.tetra
and bracelets too, and fragrant zone;	iambic.tetra

not so much life as on a summer's day	iambic.penta
the hard snow held me, save where now and then	iambic.penta
but am betrothed unto your enemy.	iambic.penta
i would build that dome in air,	iambic.tetra

a slumber did my spirit seal;	iambic.tetra

a roundel is wrought.	chol.iamb
the line too labours,  and the words move slow;	iambic.penta
those lovers scorne whom that love doth possesse?	iambic.penta
"o frabjous day! callooh! callay!"""	iambic.tetra
then must we sleep one ever-during night.	iambic.penta
in deserts, where no men abide,	iambic.tetra
only the monstrous anger of the guns.	iambic.penta
our revels now are ended. these our actors,	iambic.penta
the pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall;	iambic.penta
so fair a fancy few would weave	iambic.tetra
whose wakening should have been in paradise,	iambic.penta
in fiery ringlets from their sleep,	iambic.tetra
seeking after that sweet golden clime	chol.iamb

a sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!	iambic.penta
since there's no help, come let us kiss and part;	iambic.penta

trochee trips from long to short.	troch.tetra

when ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,	iambic.penta

dark house, by which once more i stand	iambic.tetra

and in the chasm are foam and yellow sands;	iambic.penta
down from the causeway heavily to the swamp	iambic.penta
now dark--now glittering--now reflecting gloom--	iambic.penta
love wounds with heat, as death with cold;	iambic.tetra
for how can you compete,	iambic.tri
that busie archer his sharpe arrowes tries?	iambic.penta
then ev'n of fellowship, o moone, tell me	iambic.penta
but where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.	iambic.penta
on what wings dare he aspire?	iambic.tetra
as sunlight on a stream;	iambic.tri
what the anvil? what dread grasp	iambic.tetra
and there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,	iambic.penta
and like a guilty thing i creep	iambic.tetra
with what i most enjoy contented least;	iambic.penta
her hair was long, her foot was light,	iambic.tetra
does thy life destroy.	chol.iamb
by woman wailing for her demon-lover!	iambic.penta
and a few lilies blow.	iambic.tri
that then i scorn to change my state with kings.	iambic.penta
i fondly ask; but patience to prevent	iambic.penta
not in the hands of boys but in their eyes	iambic.penta
shepherds are honest people; let them sing:	iambic.penta
our youth, our joys, and all we have,	iambic.tetra
till all the rafters rang with woman-yells,	iambic.penta
the everlasting universe of things	iambic.penta
where can we find two better hemispheres,	iambic.penta
unnumbered and enormous polypi	iambic.penta
could lonely wait my endless rest	iambic.tetra
and thereupon imagination and heart were driven	alexandr.iambic.hexa
in those looks, where whoso gazes	troch.tetra
as e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted	iambic.penta
beacons from the abode where the eternal are.	alexandr.iambic.hexa
they dwelt in their straw y pen,	iambic.tri
because she thinks death can divide	iambic.tetra
and i took all the blame out of all sense and reason,	alexandr.iambic.hexa
"hath thee in thrall!"""	iambic.di
tyger! tyger! burning bright	iambic.tetra
a slumber did my spirit seal;	iambic.tetra
i strove with none, for none was worth my strife:	iambic.penta
and watered heaven with their tears,	iambic.tetra
and i have asked to be	iambic.tri
that makes fraile flesh to feare the bitter waue?	iambic.penta
she neither hears nor sees;	iambic.tri
with craft of delight and with cunning of sound unsought,	chol.iamb
so haggard and so woe-begone?	iambic.tetra
upon those boughs which shake against the cold,	iambic.penta
no--yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,	iambic.penta
and pays us but with age and dust;	iambic.tetra
and burbled as it came!	iambic.tri
spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,	iambic.penta
the lord shall raise me up, i trust.	iambic.tetra
into their west, and straight again revive,	iambic.penta
her from her lover;	iambic.di
and on the pedestal these words appear:	iambic.penta
and far away into the sickly light,	iambic.penta
and the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows;	iambic.penta
nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;	iambic.penta
that fancy may fashion to hang in the ear of thought.	chol.iamb
and makes one little room an everywhere.	iambic.penta
beware the jabberwock, my son !	iambic.tetra
another day	iambic.di
crack nature's moulds, all germains spill at once,	iambic.penta
still growing, and on one a stake and prop,	iambic.penta
i envy no man's nightingale or spring;	iambic.penta
then reached the caverns measureless to man,	iambic.penta
far over sands marbled with moon and cloud,	iambic.penta
where my sun-flower wishes to go.	chol.iamb
then die! that she	iambic.di
nor heard the king for their own cries, but sprang	iambic.penta
that on the ashes of his youth doth lie,	iambic.penta
christmas eve, and twelve of the clock.	iambic.tetra
and further from it daily wanderest:	iambic.penta
all mimsy were the borogoves,	iambic.tetra
bid her come forth,	iambic.di
straight up and down of tall slim trees	iambic.penta
well nigh was helmet-hidden, and the name	iambic.penta
with thy black mantle till strange love grow bold,	iambic.penta
the touch of earthly years.	iambic.tri
and the mome raths outgrabe.	iambic.tri
next, when i cast mine eyes and see	iambic.tetra
and fond, that ioyest in the woe thou hast,	iambic.penta
by the embers in hearth side ease.	iambic.tri
westron wynde when wyll thow blow	iambic.tetra
as after sunset fadeth in the west;	iambic.penta
the jabberwock, with eyes of flame,	iambic.tetra
chryst yf my love wer in my armes	chol.iamb
the moving waters at their priestlike task	iambic.penta
too much alike to mark or name a place by	iambic.penta
give me the lowest place: or if for me	iambic.penta
oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs--	iambic.penta
upon those boughs which shake against the cold,	iambic.penta
where woods and winds contend, and a vast river	iambic.penta
and out of the swing of the sea.	iambic.tri
because the holy ghost over the bent	iambic.penta
my long scythe whispered and left the hay to make.	iambic.penta
now lending splendour, where from secret springs	iambic.penta
buckle! and the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion	iambic.penta
and in the dearest passage of a song.	iambic.penta
the fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows.	iambic.penta
where thirsting longing eyes	iambic.tri
true ease in writing comes from art, not chance,	iambic.penta
and look upon myself, and curse my fate,	iambic.penta
must purling streams refresh a lover's loves?	iambic.penta
then ev'n of fellowship, o moone, tell me	iambic.penta
ask for that lowest place, but thou hast died	iambic.penta
and all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;	iambic.penta
that on the ashes of his youth doth lie,	iambic.penta
shall we not lie as we have lain	iambic.tetra
that had'st thou sprung	iambic.di
the soul of adonais, like a star,	iambic.penta
could i revive within me	iambic.tri
like to the lark at break of day arising	iambic.penta
and trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,	iambic.penta
"my heart had shrunk as thin!"""	iambic.tri
that flies in the night	chol.iamb
where waterfalls around it leap for ever,	iambic.penta
and though the sager sort our deeds reprove,	iambic.penta
no motion has she now, no force;	iambic.tetra
and wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,	iambic.penta
"""come; see the oxen kneel"	iambic.tri
by thy leave i can look, i rise again;	iambic.penta
and there she wept and sighed full sore;	iambic.tetra
were neither shamed in his own	iambic.tri
life of life! thy lips enkindle	troch.tetra
make the cold air fire; then screen them	troch.tetra
who see her going loverless	iambic.tetra
yet sing and chatter	iambic.di
long time the manxome foe he sought-	iambic.tetra
can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case;	iambic.penta
at earliest morning to the door.	iambic.tetra
of pure ablution round earth's human shores,	iambic.penta
beyond red roofs about a narrow wharf	iambic.penta
and this atmosphere divinest	troch.tetra
he there does now enjoy eternall rest	iambic.penta
a faery's song.	iambic.di
and hast thou slain the jabberwock?	iambic.tetra
"how si
               lentlyand withhow wannea face"	iambic.penta
though the sedge is withered from the lake,	iambic.tetra
(pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake.-	iambic.penta
that thus so clean ly i myself can free;	iambic.penta
without sharp north, without declining west?	iambic.penta
not in lone splendour hung aloft the night	iambic.penta
descends on me; my spirit's bark is driven	iambic.penta
no mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells;	iambic.penta
whatever dies was not mixed equally;	iambic.penta
